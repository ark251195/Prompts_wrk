You are implementing Phase 1 of observability only.

Do NOT implement tracing or metrics yet.

Goal:
Ensure correlation_id is correctly generated and propagated through the entire request lifecycle.

Tasks:

1. Verify ObservabilityMiddleware:
   - correlation_id is generated if not present
   - incoming header is respected if present
   - correlation_id is stored using contextvars
   - correlation_id is added to response headers

2. Verify propagation through layers:
   Confirm correlation_id is accessible in:
   - router.py chat()
   - agent_runner.py Runner.run()
   - _stream.py AsyncGraphStreamer.stream()
   - tool execution (hr_node.py, uploaded_docs_tool.py)
   - llm.py model invocation
   - DBWriter.upload()

3. If correlation_id is not available in any layer:
   - add minimal changes only
   - do not refactor architecture
   - use contextvars instead of passing parameters everywhere

4. Add temporary debug logs (INFO level) at each layer:
   Example:
   "[OBSERVE] correlation_id=<id> component=<name>"

5. Output:
   - exact files modified
   - exact code snippets added
   - verification steps using curl or local request
   - expected console output example

Constraints:
- No OpenTelemetry spans yet
- No metrics yet
- No restructuring of existing logic
- Minimal safe changes only
