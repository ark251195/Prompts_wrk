You are implementing Phase 5 (tool-level tracing) in this codebase.

Important:
- Do NOT assume architecture.
- First, locate the single/common interface where tools are executed (the choke point).
  This is typically where tool_name + args are received and a tool is invoked (invoke/ainvoke/call).
- Only after locating that point, implement tracing there so all tools get traced automatically.

Goals:
1) Create one OpenTelemetry span per tool call.
   Span name format: "tool.invoke.<tool_name>" (sanitize tool_name if needed).
2) Spans must be children of the existing request/agent spans (http.chat_request → agent.run → langgraph.stream).
   Do not manually pass contexts; rely on current context.
3) Record errors properly:
   - record_exception
   - set span status ERROR
   - re-raise
4) Capture PII-safe attributes:
   - tool.name, tool.call_id (if present)
   - args keys (not raw values)
   - approximate args size bytes
   - result size bytes (approx; do not log content)
   - correlation_id if available in context
5) Handle async correctly:
   - If tool supports async (ainvoke / async __call__), await it.
   - If tool is sync/blocking, run it in a thread (asyncio.to_thread or anyio.to_thread.run_sync).
   - Ensure cancellation handling is correct (CancelledError should not be counted as tool failure; mark attribute tool.cancelled=true and re-raise).
6) Keep changes minimal:
   - Prefer a single patch at the choke point + at most one reusable helper.
   - Do not modify each tool implementation.

Deliverables:
A) Identify and report:
   - exact file path(s) and function(s) where the choke point is
   - how tool name/args are represented there
B) Provide a ready-to-apply code patch implementing the spans (and optional metrics if already available).
C) Provide a quick verification plan:
   - run one chat that triggers a tool
   - expected trace hierarchy snippet showing tool.invoke.<tool_name> under langgraph.stream

Constraints:
- Do not add spans inside individual LangGraph nodes.
- Do not add LLM spans yet (that is Phase 6).
- Do not log raw tool args/results (HR/PII safe).
